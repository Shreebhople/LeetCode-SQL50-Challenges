ANSWER:

#Write your MySQL query statement below
select name
from customer
where referee_id != 2 or referee_id is NULL;

Explanation:
The given Customer table consists of three columns:
‚Ä¢	id (Primary Key, unique for each customer),
‚Ä¢	name (The name of the customer),
‚Ä¢	referee_id (The ID of the customer who referred them; can be NULL if they were not referred by anyone).
The task is to find all customers who were NOT referred by the customer with id = 2.

Query Breakdown:
SELECT name
FROM customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
Step-by-Step Explanation:
1.	SELECT name
o	We only need the names of customers, so we select the name column.
2.	FROM customer
o	Specifies that we are querying from the Customer table.
3.	WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL
o	This condition ensures that we exclude customers referred by id = 2.
o	referee_id != 2 ‚Üí Includes customers who were referred by someone other than id = 2.
o	referee_id IS NULL ‚Üí Includes customers who were not referred by anyone.

6	Mark	2
‚Ä¢	Will (id = 1) ‚Üí referee_id = NULL ‚úÖ Include
‚Ä¢	Jane (id = 2) ‚Üí referee_id = NULL ‚úÖ Include
‚Ä¢	Alex (id = 3) ‚Üí referee_id = 2 ‚ùå Exclude
‚Ä¢	Bill (id = 4) ‚Üí referee_id = NULL ‚úÖ Include
‚Ä¢	Zack (id = 5) ‚Üí referee_id = 1 ‚úÖ Include
‚Ä¢	Mark (id = 6) ‚Üí referee_id = 2 ‚ùå Exclude
Output Table

Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢	!= 2 filters out customers who were referred by id = 2.
‚Ä¢	IS NULL ensures we include customers with no referee.
‚Ä¢	The result is returned in any order as per the problem statement.
This query efficiently extracts the required names while handling NULL values properly. üöÄ
