| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |

Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.


ANSWER:

#Write your MySQL query statement below
select product_id
from products
where low_fats='Y'
and recyclable='Y';

Explanation:
The given Products table contains three columns:
•	product_id (a unique identifier for each product),
•	low_fats (an ENUM value 'Y' or 'N', indicating whether the product is low fat),
•	recyclable (an ENUM value 'Y' or 'N', indicating whether the product is recyclable).
The goal is to retrieve the product IDs where both low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y'.
________________________________________

Query Breakdown:
SELECT product_id
FROM products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y'
AND recyclable = 'Y';
1.	SELECT product_id
  	This selects the product_id column to return only the IDs of the products that meet the criteria.
2.	FROM products
   Specifies that we are querying the products table.
3.	WHERE low_fats = 'Y'
   Filters the rows to include only those where the low_fats column has a value of 'Y' (indicating the product is low fat).
4.	AND recyclable = 'Y'
  	Further filters the results to include only products where the recyclable column has a value of 'Y' (indicating the product is recyclable).

Example Walkthrough:
Input Table
product_id	low_fats	recyclable
    0        Y         	N
    1       	Y	         Y
    2        N	         Y
    3        Y	         Y
    4        N         	N
•	product_id = 1 has low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y' → ✅ Include
•	product_id = 3 has low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y' → ✅ Include
•	product_id = 0 has low_fats = 'Y', but recyclable = 'N' → ❌ Exclude
•	product_id = 2 has low_fats = 'N' → ❌ Exclude
•	product_id = 4 has low_fats = 'N' → ❌ Exclude

Output
product_id
1
3
This result is correct because only product_ids 1 and 3 satisfy both conditions.
________________________________________
Key Takeaways
•	The WHERE clause is used to apply conditions.
•	The AND operator ensures that both conditions must be TRUE for a row to be included.
•	The query efficiently filters and retrieves only the required product IDs.
